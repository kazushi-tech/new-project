# Plan Creation

Whenever you create a markdown file in the ./plans directory, please make sure to have it reviewed by Codex using the codex-review skill.

# ExecPlans

When writing complex features or significant refactors, use an ExecPlan (as described in .agent/PLANS.md) from design to implementation.

# Review gate (codex-review)

At key milestones—after updating specs/plans, after major implementation steps (≥5 files / public API / infra-config), and before commit/PR/release—run the codex-review SKILL and iterate review→fix→re-review until clean.

# Task Management

When implementing features or making code changes, use the Tasks feature to manage and track progress. Break down the work into clear steps and update task status as you proceed.

# Other

When asking for a decision, use "AskUserQuestion".
